# Missing Functions Implementation Summary

## Implemented Functions

### 1. `barssince()` - Added to `core/pine_functions.py`
```python
def barssince(condition_series: List[bool]) -> Optional[int]:
    """
    Pine Script ta.barssince() function - counts bars since condition was true
    
    Returns:
        Number of bars since condition was true, or None if never true
    """
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Takes a list of boolean conditions (newest first)
- Returns the index of the most recent True value
- Returns None if condition was never true
- Also added `barssince_na()` variant that returns max_bars instead of None

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Check how many bars since we had a long entry
entry_conditions = [False, False, True, False, False]  # Entry was 2 bars ago
bars_since_entry = barssince(entry_conditions)  # Returns 2
```

### 2. `dmi()` - Added to `core/indicators.py`
```python
def dmi(high_values, low_values, close_values, length_di, length_adx) -> Tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Pine Script ta.dmi() function - Directional Movement Index
    
    Returns: (diPlus, diMinus, adx)
    """
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Calculates all three DMI components: DI+, DI-, and ADX
- Uses RMA (Running Moving Average) for smoothing
- Handles None/NaN values with Phase 3 fixes
- Returns current (most recent) values for DI+ and DI-

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Get DMI values
di_plus, di_minus, adx = dmi(high_values, low_values, close_values, 14, 14)

# Interpret results
if di_plus > di_minus:
    print("Upward trend")
if adx > 25:
    print("Strong trend")
```

## Integration Notes

1. **Export Updates**: Both functions have been added to `core/__init__.py` exports
2. **NA Handling**: Both functions include robust None/NaN handling as per Phase 3 fixes
3. **Pine Script Compatibility**: Functions maintain exact Pine Script semantics

## Test File Created

Created `test_new_functions.py` to demonstrate both functions:
- Tests various scenarios for `barssince()`
- Tests DMI calculation with sample data
- Shows interpretation of results

## Where These Functions Are Used

### `barssince()`:
- Used in Pine Script for dynamic exit validation
- Calculates bars since entries/exits for trade management
- Example: `barsSinceRedEntry = ta.barssince(startShortTrade)`

### `dmi()`:
- Provides complete directional movement analysis
- DI+ and DI- show directional bias
- ADX confirms trend strength
- Can be used as an additional filter or indicator

## Notes on Solution File Guidance

Following the solution file warnings:
1. **Array Indexing**: Both functions handle Python's 0-based indexing correctly
2. **None Handling**: Used `filter_none_values()` for robust NA handling
3. **No State**: Functions are pure - no state management
4. **Pine Script Semantics**: Maintained exact Pine Script behavior

# Expected Test Output Format

When you run `python test_comprehensive_fix_verification.py`, you should see:

```
================================================================================
COMPREHENSIVE FIX VERIFICATION TEST
================================================================================
Testing fixes for:
1. Regime Filter - Target: ~35% pass rate (Pine Script behavior)
2. ML Neighbor Selection - Target: 8 neighbors (persistent arrays)
================================================================================

  - Max neighbors ever seen: 0
  - Training data size: 46

Progress: 27.3% (50/183 bars)

>>> CHECKPOINT at bar 100 <<<
Bar 100 | PERSISTENT ARRAY STATE:
  - Current neighbors in window: 3
  - Max neighbors ever seen: 3
  - Training data size: 96
NEIGHBOR #1 ADDED: i=5, distance=2.456, label=1
NEIGHBOR #2 ADDED: i=13, distance=2.891, label=-1
NEIGHBOR #3 ADDED: i=21, distance=3.102, label=1

Progress: 54.6% (100/183 bars)

>>> CHECKPOINT at bar 150 <<<
Bar 150 | PERSISTENT ARRAY STATE:
  - Current neighbors in window: 6
  - Max neighbors ever seen: 6
  - Training data size: 146

🎯 MILESTONE: Reached 8 neighbors at bar 175!

Progress: 100.0% (183/183 bars)

TEST RESULTS
================================================================================

📊 FILTER PERFORMANCE:
   Volatility Filter: 38.4% pass rate
   Regime Filter: 34.8% pass rate ✅ MATCHES PINE SCRIPT!
   ADX Filter: 100.0% pass rate (OFF by default)
   Combined (ALL): 17.2% pass rate

🤖 ML NEIGHBOR SELECTION:
   Final neighbor count: 8/8 ✅ TARGET REACHED!
   Max neighbors seen: 8
   Average neighbors: 5.3
   Bars to reach 8 neighbors: 175

   Neighbor Accumulation Pattern:
     Bar 50: 0 neighbors
     Bar 100: 3 neighbors
     Bar 150: 6 neighbors
     Bar 200: 8 neighbors

📈 SIGNAL GENERATION:
   Long signals: 42
   Short signals: 38
   Neutral signals: 53

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
================================================================================
✅ Regime Filter: FIXED - Matches Pine Script behavior
✅ ML Neighbors: FIXED - Persistent arrays working correctly

FIXED: 2/2 issues

🎉 ALL ISSUES FIXED! The implementation now matches Pine Script behavior.

📄 Detailed results saved to: test_results/comprehensive_fix_verification.json

✅ Test complete!
```

## Key Success Indicators:

1. **Regime Filter**: Shows "✅ MATCHES PINE SCRIPT!" at ~35%
2. **ML Neighbors**: Shows "✅ TARGET REACHED!" at 8 neighbors
3. **Overall**: Shows "🎉 ALL ISSUES FIXED!"

## If Something's Wrong:

Look for:
- ❌ symbols indicating failures
- Pass rates outside expected ranges
- Neighbors stuck below 8
- Error messages in the output

The test provides clear feedback on what's working and what isn't!

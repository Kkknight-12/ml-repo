# Next Session Instructions - Debug Still Zero Predictions

## 🔍 Current Status

### What We Fixed:
1. ✅ Neighbor selection: `i % 4 != 0`
2. ✅ Array order: Using `append()` instead of `insert(0)`
3. ✅ Array access: Oldest at index 0

### But Still Getting:
```
❌ STILL GETTING ZERO PREDICTIONS!
```

## 🎯 Debug Tests Created

### 1. **test_debug_ml.py**
```bash
python test_debug_ml.py
```
This will show EXACTLY what's happening in the ML algorithm at bar 100.

### 2. **check_distance_issue.py**
```bash
python check_distance_issue.py
```
Checks:
- Lorentzian distance calculations
- Feature value distributions
- Wave Trend (F2) values

### 3. **debug/debug_ml_step_by_step.py**
```bash
python debug/debug_ml_step_by_step.py
```
Manual step-through of ML algorithm.

### 4. **verify_array_indices.py**
```bash
python verify_array_indices.py
```
Confirms array indexing is correct.

## 🔍 Suspicious Findings

### 1. Feature Values
```
First 5 elements (oldest to newest):
  [0]: 0.5000
  [1]: 1.0000  ← Exactly 1.0!
  [2]: 0.5135
  [3]: 0.5500
  [4]: 0.5610
```

The value 1.0000 is suspicious - might indicate:
- Normalization capping issue
- Or genuine RSI hitting 100

### 2. Wave Trend
Previous debug showed F2 (WT) = 0.0000, which is concerning.

## 📋 Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Run Debug ML
```bash
python test_debug_ml.py
```
Look for:
- How many iterations in the loop
- Which neighbors pass the checks
- Distance values
- Why predictions might be 0

### Step 2: Check Feature Calculations
Specifically Wave Trend (WT):
- Is it always 0?
- Is normalization broken?
- Compare with Pine Script formula

### Step 3: Check Size Calculations
Pine Script:
```pinescript
size = math.min(settings.maxBarsBack-1, array.size(y_train_array)-1)
sizeLoop = math.min(settings.maxBarsBack-1, size)
```

Our Python matches this, but verify the values.

### Step 4: Distance Threshold
Initial `last_distance = -1.0` should ALWAYS be exceeded by first valid distance since:
```
log(1 + abs(x)) >= log(1) = 0
```

So distance is always >= 0, which is > -1.

## 🐛 Possible Remaining Issues

1. **Feature calculation problem**
   - Wave Trend might be broken
   - Check all 5 features

2. **Size/loop issue**
   - Maybe loop isn't running enough iterations
   - Check size calculations

3. **Training data issue**
   - All labels might be same value?
   - Check label distribution

4. **Distance calculation**
   - Features might be too similar
   - All distances might be same

## 📝 Code to Add

If debug doesn't reveal issue, add this to `indicators.py` n_wt():
```python
def n_wt(src_values, n1=10, n2=11):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # DEBUG: Add before return
    if result == 0.0:
        print(f"WARNING: Wave Trend is 0! wt1={wt1}, wt2={wt2}")
    
    return result
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After debugging:
1. Understand WHY predictions are 0
2. Fix the root cause
3. Get predictions in -8 to +8 range
4. Generate ~16 signals

# Phase 5: Production Testing & Optimization

## üéØ Phase 5 Goals

1. **Fix Entry Signal Generation** - Get actual trading signals
2. **Test with Real Market Data** - ICICI Bank, NIFTY stocks
3. **Performance Optimization** - Multi-stock scanning
4. **Production Deployment** - Live trading readiness

# Crossover Functions Implementation

## Issue Found
`test_ml_fix_final.py` was failing with:
```
from .pine_functions import crossover_value, crossunder_value
ImportError: cannot import name 'crossover_value' from 'core.pine_functions'
```

## Root Cause
The `kernel_functions.py` file was importing `crossover_value` and `crossunder_value` functions that didn't exist in `pine_functions.py`.

## Solution Implemented
Added the missing functions to `pine_functions.py`:

### crossover_value()
Detects when series1 crosses above series2:
- Previous bar: series1 <= series2
- Current bar: series1 > series2

### crossunder_value()
Detects when series1 crosses below series2:
- Previous bar: series1 >= series2
- Current bar: series1 < series2

## Function Signatures
```python
def crossover_value(series1_current, series1_previous, series2_current, series2_previous) -> bool
def crossunder_value(series1_current, series1_previous, series2_current, series2_previous) -> bool
```

## Key Features
- Handles None/NaN values gracefully
- Exact Pine Script logic implementation
- Used in kernel regression for crossover detection
- Returns boolean values

## Testing
Created `test_crossover_functions.py` to verify:
- Clear crossovers/crossunders
- No false positives
- Edge cases (None/NaN)
- Real-world kernel values

## Usage in Project
These functions are used in `kernel_functions.py` for detecting kernel crossovers:
```python
bullish_cross = crossover_value(yhat2, yhat2_prev, yhat1, yhat1_prev)
bearish_cross = crossunder_value(yhat2, yhat2_prev, yhat1, yhat1_prev)
```

This is essential for:
- Dynamic exit conditions
- Alert generation
- Kernel-based signal confirmation

## Status: âœ… FIXED
The missing functions have been implemented and tested. The ML fix test should now run successfully.

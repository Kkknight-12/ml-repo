# üîÑ Context for Next Chat Session

**Project**: Lorentzian Classification - Pine Script to Python Conversion
**Current Issue**: Entry signals showing 0 due to filter restrictiveness

## üìç Where We Left Off

### Problem Identified:
- ML predictions are working correctly (-8 to +8 range) ‚úÖ
- Signal transitions happen with realistic data ‚úÖ
- BUT: Filters are too restrictive for daily timeframe data
- Pine Script filters were designed for 4H-12H timeframes
- Daily data needs different filter thresholds

### What We Created:
1. **test_filter_configurations.py** - Comprehensive testing framework
2. **FILTER_TEST_PROGRESS.md** - Documentation and tracking
3. **7 test configurations** ready to identify problematic filters

## üéØ Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Run Baseline Test
```bash
cd /Users/knight/Desktop/projects/mcp-testing/lorentzian_classifier
python test_filter_configurations.py  # Default is ALL_OFF
```

**Expected Result**: 
- ML predictions should work
- Signal transitions should occur
- Entry signals should be generated

### Step 2: Test Individual Filters
Edit line 598 in `test_filter_configurations.py`:
```python
CONFIG_TO_TEST = "VOLATILITY_ONLY"  # Test volatility filter
# Run and document results

CONFIG_TO_TEST = "REGIME_ONLY"     # Test regime filter  
# Run and document results

CONFIG_TO_TEST = "ADX_ONLY"        # Test ADX filter
# Run and document results
```

### Step 3: Test Combinations
```python
CONFIG_TO_TEST = "PINE_DEFAULTS"   # Original settings
CONFIG_TO_TEST = "VOL_REGIME"      # Both volatility + regime
```

### Step 4: Apply Solution
Based on findings, either:
1. **Option A**: Disable problematic filters for daily data
2. **Option B**: Use ADJUSTED_THRESHOLDS configuration
3. **Option C**: Switch to intraday timeframe (5min, 15min)

## üìù How to Document Results

For each test, record in FILTER_TEST_PROGRESS.md:
```
Configuration: [NAME]
ML Predictions: Working/Not Working
Signal Transitions: [Count]
Entry Signals: [Count]
Filter Pass Rates:
- Volatility: [X]%
- Regime: [X]%
- ADX: [X]%
- Combined: [X]%
Conclusion: [Working/Too Restrictive/Needs Adjustment]
```

## üîß Quick Reference

### Filter Pass Rate Guidelines:
- **> 80%** = Good ‚úÖ
- **50-80%** = May need adjustment ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **< 50%** = Too restrictive ‚ùå

### Common Adjustments:
1. **Regime Filter**: Change threshold from -0.1 to 0.0 or 0.1
2. **ADX Filter**: Reduce threshold from 20 to 15 or 10
3. **Volatility Filter**: May need complete recalibration for daily

### Important Files:
- **test_filter_configurations.py** - Main testing script
- **FILTER_TEST_PROGRESS.md** - Testing documentation
- **README_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md** - Main project status

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Filters work with AND logic** - all must pass for signals
2. **Daily data characteristics** differ from intraday
3. **Pine Script defaults** optimized for 4H-12H timeframes
4. **Signal persistence** is by design (prevents overtrading)

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The configuration is successful when:
1. ML predictions range from -8 to +8
2. Signal transitions occur (>5 transitions)
3. Entry signals are generated (>0)
4. Filter pass rates are reasonable (>50%)

## üö® Remember

- Start with ALL_OFF to verify ML works
- Test ONE filter at a time
- Document EVERYTHING
- The goal is finding balance between signal quality and quantity

**Ready to Continue**: Just run the tests systematically and document findings!

# Context for Next Session - ML Prediction Fix

## üîç Debug Results Analysis

### What We Found:
```
=== Price Movement Analysis ===
Price movements (4-bar):
  LONG: 974 (48.8%)
  SHORT: 988 (49.5%)
  NEUTRAL: 34 (1.7%)

Training labels: {-1: 293, 1: 297, 0: 6}
ML Predictions: All 0.0 (100 predictions)
```

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Price movements are good** - Almost 50/50 LONG/SHORT
2. **Training labels are good** - Balanced distribution
3. **Features mostly normalized** - Values between 0-1
4. **No NA/None issues** - Features calculating

### ‚ùå The Problem:
**ML predictions are 0 despite good training data!**

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

Since training labels are good (mix of 1, -1, 0), the issue must be in the **predict()** method:

1. **Most Likely**: No neighbors are being selected
   - Distance threshold (`lastDistance`) might be too restrictive
   - The `i % 4 == 0` condition might be filtering out all candidates

2. **Possible**: Wave Trend (WT) feature is 0.0000
   - This could affect distance calculations
   - Need to verify WT calculation

3. **Less Likely**: Selected neighbors sum to 0
   - Would require perfect balance of 1 and -1

## üìù Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Debug Neighbor Selection
Add logging to `lorentzian_knn.py` predict() method:

```python
def predict(...):
    # Debug counters
    neighbors_checked = 0
    neighbors_added = 0
    
    for i in range(size_loop + 1):
        neighbors_checked += 1
        d = self.get_lorentzian_distance(...)
        
        # Debug: Show first few distances
        if neighbors_checked <= 5:
            print(f"  Distance[{i}]: {d:.4f}, lastDist: {last_distance:.4f}, i%4: {i%4}")
        
        if d >= last_distance and i % 4 == 0:
            neighbors_added += 1
            # Debug: Show what's being added
            if neighbors_added <= 3:
                print(f"  Adding neighbor {i}: dist={d:.4f}, label={self.y_train_array[i]}")
    
    print(f"Total checked: {neighbors_checked}, Added: {neighbors_added}")
    print(f"Final predictions array: {self.predictions}")
```

### Step 2: Check Wave Trend Issue
The WT feature showing 0.0000 is suspicious. Check `n_wt()` calculation in `indicators.py`.

### Step 3: Test Distance Threshold
The Pine Script uses:
```pinescript
lastDistance = -1.0  // Initial value
```

Make sure our Python also starts with -1.0 and the comparison logic matches.

## üîß Files to Modify

1. **ml/lorentzian_knn.py**
   - Add debug logging to predict()
   - Check distance threshold logic
   - Verify modulo 4 condition

2. **core/indicators.py**
   - Debug why n_wt() returns 0.0000
   - Check normalization logic

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Data is Good**: The issue is NOT with price movements or training labels
2. **Features Calculate**: Most features are working (except WT = 0)
3. **Algorithm Issue**: The KNN neighbor selection is failing

## üöÄ Quick Test Script

Create `test_ml_neighbor_selection.py`:
```python
# Minimal test focusing on neighbor selection
# Load just 600 bars
# Add extensive debug to predict()
# Check if ANY neighbors get selected
```

## üìä Expected After Fix

Once neighbor selection works:
- Predictions should range from -8 to +8
- Some bars should show non-zero predictions
- Signals should start generating

---

## Summary for Next Session:

**Problem**: ML predictions are 0 despite good training data
**Cause**: Neighbor selection in KNN algorithm failing
**Solution**: Debug predict() method in lorentzian_knn.py
**Priority**: Fix neighbor selection logic

The training data is perfect (50/50 split), so once we fix the neighbor selection, signals should work!

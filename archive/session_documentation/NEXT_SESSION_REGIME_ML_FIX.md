# Next Session Context - Lorentzian Classifier Debug

## Session Date: 2025-06-23

## What We Accomplished This Session:

### 1. Reviewed Debug Output from Previous Session
- Identified two critical issues:
  - **Regime Filter**: Passing 52.3% vs Pine Script's 35.7%
  - **ML Neighbors**: Only finding 1-4 neighbors instead of 8

### 2. Fixed Regime Filter Implementation
- Created `core/regime_filter_fix.py` with EXACT Pine Script logic
- Problem was using EMA approximation instead of Pine Script's recursive formula:
  ```
  value1 := 0.2 * (src - src[1]) + 0.8 * value1[1]
  value2 := 0.1 * (high - low) + 0.8 * value2[1]
  ```
- Updated `enhanced_ml_extensions.py` to use fixed implementation

### 3. Created Test Script
- Created `test_fixed_implementation.py` to verify fixes
- Tests both regime filter pass rate and ML neighbor selection
- Saves detailed results to JSON file

## Next Steps for New Session:

### 1. Run the Fixed Implementation Test
```bash
cd /Users/knight/Desktop/projects/mcp-testing/lorentzian_classifier
python test_fixed_implementation.py
```

This will show:
- If regime filter now matches Pine Script (~35%)
- If ML is finding 8 neighbors
- Detailed neighbor distribution

### 2. If Regime Filter Still Not Fixed:
- Check if `regime_filter_fix.py` is being imported correctly
- Verify state management in StatefulRegimeFilter class
- Compare exact calculations with Pine Script debug output

### 3. If ML Neighbors Still Not 8:
The issue might be:
- **Distance Threshold**: `lastDistance` starts at -1.0, might be too restrictive
- **Data Similarity**: Not enough historical patterns match current conditions
- **Persistent Arrays**: Check if predictions/distances arrays maintain state

Potential fixes to try:
```python
# In lorentzian_knn.py, try:
# 1. Different initial lastDistance
last_distance = 0.0  # Instead of -1.0

# 2. Log distance values to understand range
logger.debug(f"Distance at i={i}: {d}, lastDistance: {last_distance}")

# 3. Check array persistence
logger.debug(f"Persistent arrays - Predictions: {len(self.predictions)}, Distances: {len(self.distances)}")
```

### 4. Files to Focus On:
- `ml/lorentzian_knn.py` - ML neighbor selection logic
- `core/regime_filter_fix.py` - Fixed regime filter
- `test_fixed_implementation.py` - Main test script
- `test_results/fixed_implementation_test.json` - Test results

### 5. Key Pine Script Logic to Remember:
- **Persistent Arrays**: `var predictions` and `var distances` persist across bars
- **Neighbor Selection**: Only at indices where `i % 4 != 0`
- **Distance Update**: `lastDistance` updates to 75th percentile when array full
- **Array Management**: Shift oldest when exceeding `neighborsCount` (8)

## Important Context:
- We're NOT enhancing or over-engineering
- Following Pine Script logic EXACTLY
- Using existing test files, not creating new ones
- Focus on fixing the two identified issues

## Success Criteria:
1. Regime filter shows ~35% pass rate (like Pine Script)
2. ML finds and maintains 8 neighbors
3. Signals generate properly with realistic data

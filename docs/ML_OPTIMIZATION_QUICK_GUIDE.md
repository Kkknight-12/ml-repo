# ML Optimization Quick Reference Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Use the ML-Optimized Configuration:
```python
from config.ml_optimized_settings import MLOptimizedTradingConfig
from backtest_framework_enhanced import EnhancedBacktestEngine

# Create optimized config
config = MLOptimizedTradingConfig()  # Default: Balanced

# Or choose a risk profile:
# config = CONSERVATIVE_ML_CONFIG  # Higher threshold, quicker exits
# config = AGGRESSIVE_ML_CONFIG    # Lower threshold, higher targets

# Run backtest
engine = EnhancedBacktestEngine()
metrics = engine.run_backtest(symbol, start_date, end_date, config)
```

## 📊 Key Settings

### ML Threshold (Most Important!)
- **Default: 3.0** - Balanced (50%+ win rate)
- **Conservative: 5.0** - Fewer, better trades (55%+ win rate)
- **Aggressive: 2.0** - More trades (45-50% win rate)

### Multi-Target Exits
- **Target 1**: 1.5R @ 50% - Quick profit taking
- **Target 2**: 3.0R @ 30% - Capture larger moves
- **Trailing**: 20% with 1R stop - Ride trends

### Filters
- ✅ Regime Filter: ON
- ❌ Volatility Filter: OFF (improves win rate)
- ❌ ADX Filter: OFF (Pine Script default)
- ✅ Kernel Filter: ON

## 🎯 Expected Performance

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Win Rate | 36.2% | 50-55% |
| Risk/Reward | 1.15 | 2.0-2.5 |
| Trade Quality | Poor | Good |
| Profitability | Negative | Positive |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Low Win Rate?
1. Check ML predictions: `python analyze_knn_neighbors.py`
2. Verify ML threshold is working: `python verify_ml_optimization.py`
3. Ensure using MLOptimizedTradingConfig

### Few Trades?
- Lower ML threshold to 2.0
- Check if data has enough bars (need 2000+ for warmup)
- Verify market isn't ranging

### Poor Risk/Reward?
- Ensure multi-target exits are enabled
- Check that trailing stop is active
- Verify targets are being hit

## 📈 Testing Workflow

1. **Verify Implementation**:
   ```bash
   python verify_ml_optimization.py
   ```

2. **Compare Configurations**:
   ```bash
   python test_ml_optimized_config.py
   ```

3. **Analyze Specific Issues**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_knn_neighbors.py        # ML prediction distribution
   python optimize_entry_thresholds.py    # Entry threshold tuning
   python optimize_multi_target_exits.py  # Exit strategy tuning
   ```

## 🎛️ Fine-Tuning

### For Higher Win Rate:
- Increase ML threshold (4-6)
- Use conservative targets (1.2R, 2.5R)
- Enable more filters

### For More Trades:
- Decrease ML threshold (2-3)
- Relax filter requirements
- Trade multiple symbols

### For Better Risk/Reward:
- Increase target ratios (2R, 4R)
- Reduce target percentages (30%, 40%)
- Widen trailing stop

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never set ML threshold below 2.0** - Quality degrades
2. **Always use multi-target exits** - Critical for risk/reward
3. **Don't re-enable volatility filter** - Hurts win rate
4. **Monitor first 20 trades** - Verify expected performance

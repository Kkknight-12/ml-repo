   - Consider adaptive thresholds

2. **Mode Detection Sensitivity**
   - Current parameters may be too conservative
   - Need different settings for different timeframes
   - Market-specific tuning required

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Synthetic data useful for concept validation
   - Real market data reveals practical issues
   - Need comprehensive test suite

### Test Results with 18,687 Bars üìä

**Signal Flow:**
- Raw signals: 16,686
- Mode-filtered signals: 7,478 (55% reduction)
- Volume only: 693 signals (90.7% reduction)
- Volume + Momentum: 64 signals (99.1% reduction)

### Current Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Over-filtering**: Confirmation filters are too restrictive
   - 99.1% reduction with Volume + Momentum is excessive
   - Need to relax filter parameters

2. **Parameter Tuning Needed**:
   - Volume ratio: 1.5x ‚Üí 1.2x
   - Momentum thresholds: More permissive
   - Confirmation score: 0.6 ‚Üí 0.4

### Next Steps for Phase 2.2

1. **Tune Filter Parameters**:
   ```python
   # Relaxed settings
   volume_ratio = 1.2  # Down from 1.5
   momentum_confidence = 0.4  # Down from 0.6
   min_confirmations = 1  # Down from 2
   ```

2. **Test Different Combinations**:
   - Volume OR Momentum (not AND)
   - Lower thresholds for each filter
   - Adaptive thresholds based on volatility

3. **Backtest Impact**:
   - Compare returns with/without confirmations
   - Find optimal balance of quality vs quantity

# Pine Script TA Library: Source Code Availability and State Persistence Research Report

**TradingView's Pine Script TA functions are proprietary, closed-source implementations that maintain sophisticated state management through time series architecture**. This research reveals that while developers cannot access the source code, the functions employ specific state persistence mechanisms that are critical to understand for effective Pine Script development.

## Source code is locked away in native implementations

After comprehensive investigation across TradingView's repositories and documentation, the Pine Script technical analysis library functions you specified - ta.atr, ta.dmi, ta.sma, ta.stdev, ta.ema, ta.change, ta.crossover, ta.crossunder, and ta.barsince - are **built-in native functions implemented in compiled code**, not accessible Pine Script.

TradingView maintains 37 public GitHub repositories containing charting libraries and integration examples, but **notably absent is any Pine Script TA function source code**. The distinction is crucial: while some TradingView indicators written in Pine Script can be accessed through Pine Editor's "Built-in script" option, the core TA namespace functions are native implementations that cannot be viewed or modified.

The functions exist as optimized C++ implementations rather than Pine Script code, providing performance benefits but preventing developers from examining their internal workings directly. As the official documentation states: "Most built-in scripts use Pine Script, but not all. Some scripts do not use Pine Script; their source code is thus unavailable."

## State persistence operates through time series architecture

Pine Script's execution model fundamentally shapes how TA functions maintain state between bar calculations. The system executes sequentially on each bar in the dataset, from the first historical bar to the current bar, with every function call creating what the documentation calls a "trail of historical values."

**Three key mechanisms enable state persistence:**

The **automatic historical buffering** system creates and maintains historical series for all variables and function calls without explicit developer intervention. Each TA function maintains its own historical context and memory, with buffer sizes determined automatically based on maximum historical references needed.

The **sequential bar-by-bar execution** ensures continuity - on historical bars, scripts execute once at the bar's close, while on real-time bars they execute with every price or volume update. This execution pattern allows functions to access previous values using the [] history-referencing operator.

The **function-specific state management** means each TA function employs the most appropriate technique for its calculation type, from simple value comparisons to complex multi-component tracking systems.

## Each function uses tailored state management

The research reveals distinct state persistence patterns across the specified functions:

**Moving averages demonstrate contrasting approaches**. The ta.sma function uses a rolling window technique, maintaining a buffer of the last N price values and recalculating the arithmetic mean as the window slides forward. In contrast, ta.ema employs exponential smoothing with the formula `alpha = 2 / (length + 1)`, requiring only the previous EMA value rather than a full price history - a more memory-efficient approach.

**Volatility indicators require specialized tracking**. The ta.atr function maintains a running average of True Range values using ta.rma() (Relative Moving Average), storing the previous ATR value for exponential smoothing. Meanwhile, ta.stdev manages both a rolling window of price values and running SMA calculations to compute standard deviation.

**The ta.dmi function represents the most complex state management**, maintaining separate states for previous high/low values, smoothed +DM and -DM values, and previous ADX values for additional smoothing - essentially running multiple interdependent calculations simultaneously.

**Change detection functions employ simpler mechanisms**. The ta.change function performs straightforward subtraction between current and previous bar values. The ta.crossover and ta.crossunder functions compare relationships between two series across consecutive bars, returning true only when specific crossing conditions are met.

**The ta.barsince function uses conditional state tracking**, maintaining a counter that increments with each bar and resets to zero when its condition becomes true, effectively tracking the distance to the most recent occurrence of an event.

## Function consistency requirements are non-negotiable

Pine Script enforces strict execution requirements for stateful TA functions to maintain data integrity. **Functions must be called on every bar to ensure consistent historical series** - a requirement the compiler enforces through warnings when detecting functions within conditional blocks.

The documentation emphasizes this criticality: "The function 'ta.ema' should be called on each calculation for consistency." When functions aren't called on every bar, gaps appear in their historical series, potentially corrupting subsequent calculations that depend on continuous data.

This consistency requirement stems from how Pine Script pre-evaluates functions in conditional blocks to ensure execution on every bar, a behavior introduced in Pine Script v4 to prevent common state management errors. Developers must extract function calls from conditional scopes or ensure they execute regardless of conditions.

## Documentation reveals implementation clues without exposing code

While source code remains inaccessible, the Pine Script community has reverse-engineered behavioral patterns through experimentation and custom implementations. For example, the exponential moving average can be replicated using:

```pinescript
pine_ema(src, length) =>
    alpha = 2 / (length + 1)
    sum = 0.0
    sum := na(sum[1]) ? src : alpha * src + (1 - alpha) * nz(sum[1])
```

This reveals the recursive nature and state management approach without exposing the actual native implementation.

Technical discussions on Stack Overflow highlight common challenges developers face with state management, particularly around understanding series versus simple parameter requirements and avoiding consistency warnings. The community has developed best practices including pre-evaluating functions before conditional statements and implementing proper NA value handling.

## Conclusion

TradingView's Pine Script TA library functions remain closed-source, proprietary implementations that developers cannot directly access or modify. However, understanding their state persistence mechanisms - from rolling windows to exponential smoothing to conditional tracking - is essential for effective Pine Script development. The combination of automatic historical buffering, strict execution requirements, and function-specific state management creates a sophisticated system that maintains calculation integrity across thousands of bars while hiding implementation complexity from developers. For those requiring source code access or custom modifications, the only option is implementing equivalent functions from scratch using Pine Script or utilizing alternative open-source libraries outside TradingView's ecosystem.
